# **Software Design**

## Short Term Goals
    * Make sure ships are placed legally
    * Have a bot that randomly places ships on board
    * Have the player continuously fire at the board until they sink all the enemy ships
    * Clean up the play_game() function

## Medium Term Goals
    * Have the player start the game with placing ships on their board
    * Have the bot randomly fire back at the player
    * Have the play_game() function take turns between the player and the bot

## Long Term Goals
    * Create AI that can play against the player
    * Create a graphics board with GUI
    * Have the ships be draggable objects onto the boards
    * Have the tiles on the board be clickable in order to fire

## Stretch Goals
    * allow for other moves, such as a scatter-shot(Possibly a point system for different moves)
